Now just after our public repos on Github we are also publishing some Gists
that we hope are helpful to you all and bring some structure and
overview in the field of Green Software Engineering.

When we started to get an overview in the field of Green Coding and Green
Software Engineering we found a landscape of many solo coders / bloggers.

The ressources are quite plenty, although very scattered and very different in
their quality.

In our three Gists we tried to condense this down to only the most valueable
ressources.

We decided on three categories:

- [Green Software Engineering Articles / Blogs / Personas](https://gist.github.com/green-coding-berlin/5ad4c2c9d1681cea376a1bf985cc2a44)

- [Green Software Engineering Desktop](https://gist.github.com/green-coding-berlin/29a7f1c835b7e87926c3cfe976dc3f3a)

- [Green Software Engineering Web](https://gist.github.com/green-coding-berlin/f38209e0810605d72ee72a0d0f4eefcd)


Especially the last Gist and it's including links is the topic we focust most here
in Green Coding Berlin.
The most promising link in there is probably the Green Software Foundation and
their planned [Green Software Projects](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects)

We are also working on this topic and planning to be part of the Green Software Foundation
either as a Group / NGO or as contributors.
As soon as we have some updates on this topic we will announce it in the blog.

For any feedback regarding our Gists or if you want to supply some interesting
links we missed please hit us up at info@green-coding.org
