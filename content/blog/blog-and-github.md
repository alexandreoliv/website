Today we are launching our blog, which will hopefully deliver frequent updates
to what we @ Green Coding Berlin are currently working.

First update comes right with this first blog-entry and is regarding our
Github Repository.

At https://github.com/green-coding-berlin you can find our code repositories
with all the source code that we generate in our meetups and in internal projects.

Currently it only contains our website, which is made with HUGO.
