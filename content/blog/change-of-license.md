As some of you following our [Green Coding github](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin)
have maybe noticed is that we have changed the license of some of our
repositories.

The tools and the demo code where prior licensed under MIT, which is a software
license that we come to love through popular libraries like [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails),
[Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin)
and many more ...

However we believe that our code is not seen as a library, but as a ready
made and directly usable tool, that when remixed or integrated into a bigger
product it shall still be absolutely free and open to anyone.

This is because it was specifically designed to make the energy usage of software
visible and open to anyone. That includes not only the data that is coming out
of the tool, but also the exact protocols and methods that where used to
create these measurements.

We belive this cannot be done with an MIT license as it enables actors to keep
some part of the measurement software closed due to the mindset that this has
any benefit for a monetary drive actor that may want to keep it's methods
a "company secret".

Therefore we licensed our repositories containing the metrics tool and also
the demo code under AGPLv3.
This license guarantees, that as soon as the software is integrated or interacted
with or even if somebody creates an API endpoint with it that outputs software
energy measurements it MUST be released as AGPLv3 also to the community.
