# (Green) Software Developer

At Green Coding Berlin we create a green software community and ecosystem in Berlin. Our flagship work is an [open-source green software certifcation toolchain](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/green-metrics-tool) that let's you quantify the energy consumption of arbitrary software in typical real world usage scenarios.

The goal is to create an industry standard that can certify software in it's impact on the environment and to reduce resource usage, bloated software and unneeded computations.

&nbsp;

### What you will be working on:
The work at Green Coding for our toolchain covers an extensive scope where you come into contact with a lot of tools that may be new to you. However, we supply an extensive onboarding and enough time to learn these tools if you are not already familiar with them.

For all of these sub-parts you will have at least one team-mate which you will be working with. It is possible to switch teams or to focus on only parts of the mentioned tasks.

We also do host talks and workshops for the Berlin Community for free and also for companies in-house. These talks range from talks about the current state of
Green Coding, Best green software design practices to custom workshops where we transform old websites / shops to a state of the art cloud-hosted / edge-hosted website with serverless functions and dynamic edge network caching.

We encourage you to take part in this mission and also get to know new technologies while doing so, but this part is optional for the job (see below).

The following list provides the full scope of the tool which we hope to reach within a year:

- You will be working on the tool to measure and certify resource usage of arbitrary software
- Ability to test arbitrary console applications in docker setup
- Ability to test arbitrary web app through instrumented Google Chrome headless
- Ability to test desktop application on Linux / Windows through synthetic clicks / input on specified desktop test machine
- Develop a flexible and extensible specification for the JSON format that specifies how to instrument the software and to simulate the standard usage flow of an application (similar to Selenium on web)
- Creation of baseline values and categories for arbitrary software
- Web-Frontend to visualize all collected open-source metrics
- Adapting tool to be compatible with [Green Software Foundation SCI spec](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/software-carbon-intensity-sci-specification)
- Adapting tool to be compatible with ["Blauer Engel" / Umweltbundesamt Green Software Certification](https://www.blauer-engel.de/en/productworld/resources-and-energy-efficient-software-products)
- Development of a [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) plugin

- (Optionally) Community-Building, Speaking and Mentoring in our Meetups and Workshops.

### Your qualification:
If you feel motivated and apt to work on the tasks mentioned in the section before that is all we ask for :)

Juniors and senior developers are welcome. Since we are looking for more than one developer
and already have one senior developer on board we will create a healthy mix.
So as a senior be reassured, that you will work with people on the same qualification and level and also
have some mentoring / delegation part.
As a junior be reassured that you will get enough guidance for the tasks.

You should have at least around a 1 year experience in using one of these programming languages: Node.JS / Javascript, Python or PHP.

However if you are not too familiar with parts of the tasks mentioned before but feel confident you
can learn them in a short time, also do not hesitate to apply.

We value motivation and interest for learning over current coding profession, since this is the most important part when working in the climate positive sector.

&nbsp;

### Working hours and pay

The job is possible as part-time or full-time.

Please include your expected salary and part-time/full-time preference in your email.

&nbsp;

### What can you expect from us?

We are currently functioning as a non-profit consisting of a [team of two people](/#nav-team).
For the scope above we secured funding for our first year to create a team of up to 5 people with a part-time office in Berlin-Mitte.

Spoken languages are english or german. So if you are fluent in any, you are good to go.

We hope to be fully staffed and functional by mid-April.

The job would be preferrably as a regular employment with a one-year contract that is open to extension depending of the adoption and impact of the project.
However freelance applications are also welcome.

All our work in non-profit will be integrated into the greater scope of the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/) to allow for more traction and impact.
All code you write will and must be open source and free use (CC / MIT license).

&nbsp;

### Remote or in office?
Both is possible. However depending on your qualification we require you to be in Berlin for the duration of the onboarding.

For everyone in Berlin we will be doing at least once a week meetings / get-togethers in person though for easier demoing and of course also socialising.

&nbsp;

### How to apply
Just shoot us an email at jobs@green-coding.org with a quick intro and why you would like to join our team.
Please also include a quick comment on your skills regarding the aformetioned features we want the tool to incorporate.

A link to your Linked-In and Github profile is usually helpful.

There is no need for formal documents. If you want to send them however, feel free to attach them.
